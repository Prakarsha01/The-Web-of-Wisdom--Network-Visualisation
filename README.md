# The web of Wisdom

This repository contains the code for an interactive network visualisation made for the article "[The Web of Wisdom: Zooming Out of LLMs for a Bit](https://medium.com/@prakarsha/the-web-of-wisdom-zooming-out-of-llms-for-a-bit-6c2007d15108)". 

The visualisation aims to show the intricate inter-relationship between many different computational models as a network graph. And the zoom out effect gives a pun intended literal effect of the title which initially is zoomed into the computational model of LLMs but later zooms out to show it's the larger web of computational models.
